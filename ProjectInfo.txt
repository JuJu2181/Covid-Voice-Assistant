"WEB SCRAPPING THE COVID-19 DATA AND USING VOICE ASSISTANT TO GET DETAILS"

Based on the knowledge gained from 15 days Python Training I have developed this project.
Here in this project I used the requests and BeautifulSoup4 module to webscrap the latest 
details on COVID-19 of various countries and store it in a JSON file named "covid.json".
Also I have used the pyttsx3 module along with speech_recognition module to guide the 
voice assistant to update the data in JSON file as well as getting specific details on a 
particular country. Here the details of COVID-19 statistics will be updated dynamically based
on scrapped webpage.

Webpage I scrapped : https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries

files included: covid.json, covid_speaker.py

Please Note : Although I tried to make this project free of bugs and errors. There may be certain bugs and runtime 
errors still remaining in this project. Also do note that an active internet connection is required to run this project 
Also I will be updating soon. 

Thank you
